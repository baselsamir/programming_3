#This example demonstrate communications between processes
"""
Effective use of multiple processes usually requires some communication between them, so that work can be divided and results can be aggregated.
multiprocessing supports two types of communication channel between processes:
-Queue
-Pipe
"""
"""
Pipes : A pipe can have only two endpoints. Hence, it is preferred over queue when only two-way communication is required. 
multiprocessing module provides Pipe() function which returns a pair of connection objects connected by a pipe. 
The two connection objects returned by Pipe()represent the two ends of the pipe. Each connection object has send() 
and recv() methods (among others).
"""
# Pipe Example

import multiprocessing 

def sender(conn, msgs): 
	""" 
	function to send messages to other end of pipe 
	"""
	for msg in msgs: 
		conn.send(msg) 
		print("Sent the message: {}".format(msg)) 
	conn.close() 

def receiver(conn): 
	""" 
	function to print the messages received from other 
	end of pipe 
	"""
	while 1: 
		msg = conn.recv() 
		if msg == "END": 
			break
		print("Received the message: {}".format(msg)) 

if __name__ == "__main__": 
	# messages to be sent 
	msgs = ["hello", "hey", "hru?", "END"] 

	# creating a pipe 
	parent_conn, child_conn = multiprocessing.Pipe() 

	# creating new processes 
	p1 = multiprocessing.Process(target=sender, args=(parent_conn,msgs)) 
	p2 = multiprocessing.Process(target=receiver, args=(child_conn,)) 

	# running processes 
	p1.start() 
	p2.start() 

	# wait until processes finish 
	p1.join() 
	p2.join()
